# esys-escript-applications
A library of esys-escript application scripts. 

These scripts have been removed from the core esys-escript 
when building version 6 as they are not neccessarily been supported anymore.

Please get in contact with l.gross@uq.edu.au if you have problems to run these script. I am happy to 
provide some insight to run them although are very old and have not been touched for many years.
